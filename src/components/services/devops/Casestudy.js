    <h5>Docusign</h5>
    <p>Docusign’s development has always been Agile. But taking the next step into DevOps processes was not so easy. Due to the nature of their business (contracts and signatures), things like continuous integration and delivery are undoubtedly a serious challenge.</p>

    <h5>Forter</h5>
    <p>Similar to Docusign, Forter’s application is dependent on fast-paced and sensitive transactions. Forter put a large emphasis on self-healing issues driven by strong incident management. They’ve built a nice architecture for handling all issues.</p>

    <h5>Turnitin</h5>
    <p>Turnitin is a platform to help improve students’ writing. (I could have used that while in school.) I learned a lot from Samantha, a Database Manager at Turnitin, during her presentation on how monitoring is used to help with database performance in their application.</p>

          <h5>Gengo</h5>
          <p>Gengo is a translation platform. It is used both by commercial end users and by developers for integration into their application. They have a similar point of view to Forter where they chose smart monitoring as a path, not only better production applications, but also to larger goals such as freeing up time on the team to innovate.</p>

          <p>Even more than Etsy, Netflix is showcased as the DevOps dream. And there is no lack of examples demonstrating how their environment fires on all cylinders (and all the cool things they are doing).</p>
